# Building a Master’s Program List: Strategy First, Prestige Second

Most people build their Master’s program list by ranking universities and then working down. Admissions committees don’t evaluate you that way—and neither should you.

This guide helps you build a **strategic, tiered program list** that balances ambition, fit, funding, and realistic outcomes.

## 1. Start with Your Outcomes (Not School Names)

Before you think about rankings, answer:

1. **What roles do you want 1–3 years after graduation?**  
   - Job function (e.g., policy analyst, data scientist, product manager, program officer).  
   - Sector (public, private, NGO, multilateral, academia-adjacent).

2. **Where do you want to be located?**  
   - Geography affects recruitment, internships, and networks.

3. **What skills do you actually need from the degree?**  
   - Technical skills (stats, coding, domain-specific methods).  
   - Professional skills (management, communication, leadership).  
   - Domain knowledge (health systems, climate, security, finance, etc.).

You can’t judge program fit until you know what the program is supposed to help you *do*.

## 2. Identify Program Types that Match Your Goals

For each possible program, ask:

- Is this program **research-oriented**, **professional**, or **hybrid**?  
- Does that match your **next step** (PhD later vs. industry/government roles now)?  
- Is the curriculum structured to provide the **skills and tools** you listed earlier?

If your primary goal is **career transition**, prioritize:

- Programs with strong **career services**, employer connections, and internship structures.  
- Programs whose alumni are already in the roles/geographies you want.

If your primary goal is **PhD preparation**, prioritize:

- Programs with research assistantships, thesis options, and strong faculty in your area.  
- Opportunities for independent or supervised research.

## 3. Reading Between the Lines on Program Websites

When reviewing program pages, look at:

1. **Curriculum structure**  
   - Core courses: what baseline skills are assumed/expected?  
   - Electives: how much room do you have to specialize?  
   - Tracks or concentrations: do any map directly onto your goals?

2. **Faculty and research centers**  
   - Are there faculty whose interests clearly match your own?  
   - Are there labs/centers where you could do projects or RA work?

3. **Career outcomes and employment reports**  
   - Actual roles and organizations—not just “employed in X months.”  
   - Geographic distribution of alumni.  
   - Typical salary bands (especially for professional programs).

4. **Program culture and cohort profile**  
   - Average age, years of experience, and backgrounds.  
   - Is this a fit for where you are in your career?

Make notes in a simple table or spreadsheet rather than relying on memory.

## 4. Building a Tiered List

A healthy Master’s list usually includes:

- **Ambitious tier (reach programs):**  
  Schools where you are competitive but not guaranteed—often highly selective or prestige-heavy.

- **Core tier (strong fits):**  
  Programs where your profile and the cohort profile line up closely.

- **Safety/anchor tier (solid options):**  
  Programs where you’re well above the typical bar and would still be happy to attend.

For most applicants, a balanced list might look like:

- 2–3 ambitious programs  
- 3–5 core programs  
- 1–2 safety/anchor programs  

You can adjust based on budget, bandwidth, and how risky your profile is.

## 5. Funding, Cost, and Feasibility

A program is not a real option if it’s not **financially feasible**.

As you build your list, track:

- **Tuition and fees** (including differential rates for international students).  
- Cost of living in the city/region.  
- Availability of scholarships, assistantships, and part-time work.  
- Realistic loan options (and their implications for your post-grad salary).

Flag:

- Programs where you **must** secure funding to attend.  
- Programs you could attend with partial funding or savings.  
- Programs that are only realistic if you receive a specific award.

Later, you can integrate this with `masters_funding_and_scholarships.md`.

## 6. Fit Checks Before You Finalize the List

Before you lock your program list, run each school through these questions:

1. **Do my goals make sense given this program’s outcomes?**  
2. **Can I tell a specific, credible story about why this program—beyond prestige?**  
3. **Do I meet (or nearly meet) the academic and quantitative bar?**  
4. **Would I be okay if this were the only program I got into?**  
   - For your anchor programs, the answer should be “yes.”

If you can’t answer these clearly, you may need to adjust your list—or research the program more deeply.

## 7. Connecting This to the Rest of the Toolkit

Once you have a working program list, you can:

- Use `masters_sop_strategy.md` to tailor your Statement of Purpose to each program.  
- Use `masters_cv_resume_strategy.md` to align your CV/resume with your target roles.  
- Use `masters_application_timeline.md` to plan when to contact recommenders, book tests, and submit.

Your program list isn’t just a set of names. It’s the **anchor** for every other strategic choice you make in your Master’s applications.
