# Master’s CV & Resume Strategy  
How to Present Your Experience for Graduate Admissions

Your CV or resume is often the *first* document an admissions committee scans, long before they read your Statement of Purpose. As a former professor, I can tell you exactly what happens:

**Readers are looking for evidence of readiness, impact, and progression — not a list of tasks.**

This document explains how to craft a competitive, graduate-focused CV that supports your story, strengthens your credibility, and positions you as a mature, capable applicant.

## 1. The Purpose of a Master’s CV (According to Committees)

Graduate admissions reviewers look for:

### **1. Academic readiness**  
Coursework, research experience, writing samples, or projects that reflect analytical depth.

### **2. Professional maturity**  
Even for academic Master’s degrees, committees value applicants who demonstrate initiative, responsibility, and real-world experience.

### **3. Impact and progression**  
At The Admit Lab, I remind applicants constantly:  
**Your CV should show growth — not stagnation.**

### **4. Skills that map onto program expectations**  
This includes technical, analytical, quantitative, or domain-specific skills.

## 2. The Admit Lab Recommended CV Structure

Based on thousands of successful applications I’ve overseen, this structure works across fields:

### **1. Education**  
- Degree, institution, graduation date  
- Key coursework (strategically selected)  
- Academic honors  
- GPA (only if strong or required)

### **2. Research Experience** (if applicable)  
- Labs, projects, independent studies  
- Methods used  
- Outcomes: papers, posters, presentations, or code

### **3. Professional Experience**  
Describe roles through **impact**, not tasks:

- Led X initiative resulting in Y measurable change  
- Analyzed X data to support Y policy decision  
- Redesigned workflow to improve speed/accuracy by X%

### **4. Skills**  
Split into categories if needed:
- Technical  
- Quantitative  
- Programming  
- Languages  
- Domain-specific methodologies  

### **5. Projects & Publications**  
Especially important for technical, data, CS, and design programs.

### **6. Leadership & Service**  
Master’s programs value collaboration, mentorship, and community involvement.

## 3. How to Write Strong Bullet Points (The Admit Lab Method)

Weak applicants write bullets that read like job descriptions.

Strong applicants use **impact-oriented, results-driven bullets**, such as:

- “Developed a statistical forecasting tool improving prediction accuracy by 18%.”  
- “Led a 5-person team to analyze policy outcomes across 40 municipalities.”  
- “Built a full-stack data dashboard adopted by 3 departments.”

Structure:

**Action verb → Project → Skills used → Outcome (quantified when possible)**

---

## 4. Tailoring Your CV to the Program Type

### **For professional Master’s programs**  
Emphasize:

- Skills gained  
- Quant/technical preparation  
- Leadership or project execution  
- Real-world impact

### **For research-oriented programs**  
Emphasize:

- Research experience  
- Academic writing  
- Methods (qualitative or quantitative)  
- Intellectual curiosity and independent projects

## 5. Mistakes That Weaken a CV (From My Faculty Experience)

I saw these constantly when I served on admissions committees:

- Bullets with no outcomes  
- Walls of text  
- Listing everything you’ve ever done (instead of curating)  
- Vague skill claims with no evidence  
- GPA included when it hurts you  

At The Admit Lab, I regularly restructure CVs to eliminate these issues and highlight readiness, maturity, and direction.

## 6. How Your CV Supports Your SOP

Your CV provides the **evidence** that your SOP synthesizes into a coherent story.

Your SOP says:  
**“Here’s where I’m headed.”**

Your CV says:  
**“Here’s what I’ve already done to prepare.”**

When these two align, committees feel confident admitting you.
