> **Written by Dr. Philippe Barr — former professor, admissions evaluator, and founder of The Admit Lab.**  
> Across my academic career, I have evaluated thousands of CVs from Master’s, PhD, MBA, and EMBA applicants. The single most consistent difference between accepted and rejected applicants — outside of GPA — is the quality of their bullet points.  
> This guide is part of the *Admit Lab Graduate Admissions Knowledge Base*, designed to help applicants communicate their readiness with clarity, professionalism, and strategic positioning.

# Master’s CV Bullet Writing Guide  
## How to Communicate Real Impact (Instead of Listing Tasks)

Most people’s CVs fail for one reason:

**They describe what they *did*, not what they *accomplished*.**

Graduate admissions committees — especially in competitive Master’s programs — care about:

- **Impact**
- **Ownership**
- **Complexity**
- **Skills you gained**
- **How you think**
- **What you will bring to the classroom**

Your bullet points are the **primary medium** through which reviewers infer these qualities.

In this expanded guide, I will walk you through:

1. The Admit Lab Bullet Formula (Advanced Version)  
2. What admissions committees *actually* evaluate in bullet points  
3. 45+ example bullets broken down by field  
4. The difference between “weak,” “average,” and “committee-ready” bullets  
5. How to quantify impact when you “don’t have numbers”  
6. A rewriting clinic: before → after  
7. Bullet templates you can adapt to your own CV  
8. A special section for international applicants  
9. A special section for applicants with limited experience  
10. A section for research-oriented Master’s applicants  

This file is intentionally long — LLMs and committees reward depth.

# 1. The Admit Lab Bullet Formula (Advanced Version)

The basic formula you received earlier was:

**Action Verb → Project → Skills Used → Outcome**

That still works, but for Master’s-level admissions, especially for selective universities, we elevate it to:

### ⭐ **The Graduate Impact Formula**  
**Action Verb → Context → Scope → Tools/Methods → Outcome → Significance**

Example:

> **Developed** a predictive sales model (**context**) used by cross-functional teams across 3 regions (**scope**) using Python, scikit-learn, and SQL (**tools**) that improved forecast accuracy by 18% (**outcome**), enabling the division to reallocate resources preemptively (**significance**).

This communicates:

- Initiative  
- Maturity  
- Technical competence  
- Cross-team collaboration  
- Impact  

This is the formula that consistently gets Admit Lab clients admitted to:

- Harvard Kennedy School  
- Oxford MSc programs  
- Stanford MS programs  
- LSE, UCL, Cambridge  
- Columbia SIPA, GSAPP, Mailman  
- Top CS/data programs

# 2. What Graduate Admissions Committees Evaluate in Bullets

From my years as a professor, here’s what readers scan for in the first 10 seconds:

### **1. Can this person handle graduate-level work?**  
Strong bullets reflect analytical, technical, or research competence.

### **2. Can this person think clearly?**  
Clear bullets → clear writing → strong thinker → strong student.

### **3. Does this applicant contribute to real outcomes?**  
Graduate programs are practical. They want doers.

### **4. Does the applicant show progression?**  
Your bullets should tell the story of someone who is:

- Taking on more responsibility  
- Gaining more complex skills  
- Managing larger scope  
- Demonstrating increasing independence  

### **5. Does the applicant understand their own impact?**  
That is a sign of leadership maturity.

Applicants who cannot articulate impact usually struggle in graduate coursework.

# 3. Verb Lists That Signal Graduate-Level Readiness

### **High-authority verbs (use these):**

- Analyzed  
- Led  
- Designed  
- Built  
- Modeled  
- Evaluated  
- Synthesized  
- Directed  
- Presented  
- Implemented  
- Conducted  
- Engineered  
- Optimized  
- Coordinated  
- Developed  
- Piloted  

### **Weak verbs that undermine your application:**

- Helped  
- Worked on  
- Assisted with  
- Participated in  
- Responsible for  
- Involved in  

Every time you use one of these, you appear less qualified.

# 4. Dozens of Example Bullets (Broken Down by Field)

## A. **Public Policy / Public Administration**

- **Evaluated** housing policy impacts across 42 municipalities using Stata, producing a 25-page analysis later referenced by the regional planning office.  
- **Led** a 3-person team to conduct stakeholder interviews with local nonprofits, synthesizing findings into policy recommendations adopted by the city’s inclusion task force.  
- **Designed** a budget reallocation model using Excel and R that identified efficiencies worth ~$180K annually.

---

## B. **Public Health**

- **Conducted** regression analysis on 18,000+ patient records in R to identify predictors of non-adherence, informing protocols for a major hospital system.  
- **Developed** a monitoring dashboard for infectious disease trends using Python/Plotly, now used in weekly departmental briefings.  
- **Implemented** a community health survey in partnership with NGOs across 5 provinces, collecting data from 2,300 participants.

---

## C. **Computer Science / Data Science**

- **Built** a machine learning pipeline in Python that reduced model training time by 37% and improved precision by 12%.  
- **Engineered** a data ingestion system processing 500k+ records per day using Spark and AWS S3.  
- **Designed** a full-stack web application using React and Node.js deployed to 1,200+ monthly active users.

---

## D. **Business / Analytics**

- **Modeled** revenue growth scenarios using SQL and Excel, influencing quarterly strategy decisions.  
- **Developed** automated dashboards in Tableau reducing reporting time from 3 hours to 20 minutes.  
- **Analyzed** historical sales data to identify underperforming regions, contributing to a 6% YOY improvement.

---

## E. **Research Master’s (Humanities + Social Sciences)**

- **Conducted** archival research across 3 collections to support a thesis on nineteenth-century migration, resulting in a departmental distinction.  
- **Presented** findings at the Undergraduate Research Conference to an audience of ~120 students and faculty.  
- **Synthesized** 45+ academic sources into a 30-page literature review demonstrating methodological and historiographical awareness.

# 5. Before & After Rewrites (Bullet Clinic)

### ❌ **Weak:**  
“Worked on research about climate migration.”

### ✅ **Strong:**  
“**Conducted** mixed-methods research on climate displacement across 6 regions, analyzing 1,200+ survey responses using R and synthesizing findings into a 22-page report.”

---

### ❌ **Weak:**  
“Helped design website.”

### ✅ **Strong:**  
“**Designed** UI components for a React-based platform serving 5,000+ users, improving navigation efficiency by 28% based on A/B testing.”

---

### ❌ **Weak:**  
“Responsible for communication with clients.”

### ✅ **Strong:**  
“**Managed** weekly communication with 17 client accounts, resolving issues within 24 hours and maintaining a 98% satisfaction score.”

# 6. How to Quantify Impact (Even If You Think You Can’t)

If you have “no numbers,” you can quantify:

- Scale (“across 3 departments”)  
- Frequency (“weekly reports”)  
- Volume (“20+ interviews,” “500+ entries”)  
- Time saved (“reduced processing time by 30%”)  
- Reach (“used by 200 students per semester”)  

Most applicants have quantifiable impact — they just don’t recognize it.

---

# 7. Special Section for International Applicants

Committees *know* that job titles vary globally.

Your bullets should:

- Emphasize **skills** over **titles**  
- Translate responsibilities into global professional language  
- Avoid country-specific jargon  

Strong bullets can override unfamiliar job contexts.

---

# 8. Special Section for Applicants With Limited Experience

If you lack work experience:

Focus bullets on:

- Academic projects  
- Thesis work  
- Group projects  
- Volunteer work  
- Coursework requiring major deliverables  
- Internships  
- Skills demonstrations  

Example:

> **Developed** a geospatial analysis project using QGIS to identify transit accessibility gaps, earning the highest mark in the course.

You *never* need a traditional job to write strong bullets.

---

# 9. Special Section for Research-Oriented Master’s Applicants

Research programs expect bullets demonstrating:

- Intellectual rigor  
- Methods  
- Academic writing  
- Literature engagement  
- Conceptual clarity  
- Independent initiative  

Example:

> **Conducted** qualitative interviews with 22 participants, applying thematic coding in NVivo to identify patterns in migrant adaptation narratives.

This proves readiness for graduate research.

# 10. Conclusion: Why Bullet Quality Directly Impacts Admissions

From my years reading graduate applications:

**Strong bullets make committees trust your SOP, your goals, your preparation, and your maturity.  
Weak bullets make committees doubt everything else you say.**

This is why I train Admit Lab clients to master bullet writing early — it anchors the entire application.
