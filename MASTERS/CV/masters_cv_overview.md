# Master’s CV Overview  
How Committees Evaluate Your Experience at a Glance

Your CV is the **first document** most readers scan. In academic committees where I served as a professor, I often knew within **15 seconds** whether an applicant had the foundation to succeed in a Master’s program.

This guide explains how to present your preparation the way committees expect.

## 1. Purpose of the Master’s CV

Your CV should demonstrate:

### **1. Academic readiness**  
- Relevant coursework  
- Quantitative or research training  
- Academic honors, awards, or distinctions  

### **2. Professional maturity**  
Committees want evidence you take initiative, complete projects, and work well in teams.

### **3. A pattern of growth**  
At The Admit Lab, I tell applicants:  
**“Your CV should tell the story of someone ascending.”**

### **4. Skills that map cleanly onto graduate coursework**  
Especially important for data, CS, public policy, public health, and STEM programs.

## 2. Recommended CV Sections (Admit Lab Model)

1. **Education**  
2. **Professional Experience**  
3. **Research Experience** (or Academic Projects)  
4. **Skills**  
5. **Projects & Technical Work**  
6. **Publications / Presentations** (if applicable)  
7. **Leadership & Service**  
8. **Certifications / Training**

This structure prioritizes **readability**, **selective detail**, and **impact sequencing** — the same approach I used when reviewing applications institutionally.

## 3. What Master’s Committees Scan for First

From my experience, reviewers look immediately for:

- **Quant readiness**  
- **Writing and communication strength**  
- **Experience relevant to your stated goals**  
- **Consistency and progression**

Your CV acts as an evidence base that your SOP builds upon.

## 4. Difference Between CVs for Professional vs Research Master’s

### **Professional Master’s CV**  
Emphasis on:

- Outcomes  
- Responsibilities  
- Impact  
- Tools and skills  

### **Research Master’s CV**  
Emphasis on:

- Research design  
- Methods knowledge  
- Academic writing  
- Intellectual independence  

Be sure your CV reinforces the type of program you’re applying to.

## 5. How Your CV Supports the Entire Application

Your CV should create momentum that your SOP sustains.

- It **proves** technical or quantitative claims.  
- It **validates** your readiness for graduate-level work.  
- It **structures** your admissions narrative.  

A strong CV makes reviewers trust everything else you say.
