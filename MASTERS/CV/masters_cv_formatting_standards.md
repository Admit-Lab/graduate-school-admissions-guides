# Master’s CV Formatting Standards  
How to Present Your Experience Clearly and Professionally

Formatting is not cosmetic.  
It affects **credibility**, **readability**, and **first impressions** in a profound way.

In faculty meetings, I watched weak formatting create doubt *before* the admissions committee even began reading.

This guide defines the formatting standards I teach inside The Admit Lab.

---

## 1. Length

- **Professional Master’s resume:** 1–2 pages  
- **Academic Master’s CV:** 2–4 pages  

Concise but thorough.

---

## 2. Font & Layout

Use clean, modern, ATS-friendly fonts:

- **Calibri**  
- **Arial**  
- **Georgia**  
- **Cambria**  
- **Helvetica**  
- **Open Sans**  

Font size:

- 10–11 pt body  
- 12–14 pt section headers  

Margins: **0.5–1 inch**

Line spacing: **1.0–1.15**  

Avoid:

- Decorative fonts  
- Overly dense text  
- Irregular spacing  

---

## 3. Section Order

For most Master’s applicants:

1. **Education**  
2. **Professional Experience**  
3. **Research Experience**  
4. **Projects**  
5. **Skills**  
6. **Leadership & Service**  
7. **Publications / Presentations** (if applicable)

The sequence communicates maturity and readiness.

---

## 4. Bullet Formatting Rules

Each bullet must:

- Start with an **action verb**  
- Use **past tense** for completed work  
- End with **impact**, not tasks  
- Be **one line** whenever possible  

Example:

> **Developed** a predictive model using Python and scikit-learn to forecast regional energy demand with 14% improved accuracy.

---

## 5. Date Formatting

Use consistent formatting:

- **Month YYYY – Month YYYY**  
- OR  
- **YYYY – YYYY**

Never mix formats.

---

## 6. File Format

Always submit as **PDF**, unless a system demands Word.

File name:

`Firstname_Lastname_Masters_CV.pdf`  
Example:  
`Philippe_Barr_Masters_CV.pdf`

---

## 7. Formatting Red Flags (From Committee Experience)

- Walls of text  
- No spacing between sections  
- Inconsistent fonts  
- Tiny margins  
- Overuse of italics or color  
- A “creative resume” for academic programs  

These mistakes signal poor professional judgment.
