# Portfolio Guidelines for Master’s Applicants  
## How to Show Your Best Work in Design, Data, CS, and Applied Programs

Some Master’s programs — especially in design, HCI, human-centered data science, certain CS tracks, and digital products — ask for a **portfolio** in addition to your CV and Statement of Purpose.

A portfolio is not a scrapbook of everything you’ve done.  
It is a **curated argument** about how you think, what you build, and how you solve problems.

In this guide, I’ll cover:

1. Which programs typically expect portfolios  
2. The purpose of a portfolio in graduate admissions  
3. The structure of a strong portfolio  
4. Case study anatomy (for design, data, and CS)  
5. How many projects to include  
6. Common portfolio mistakes  
7. Technical / hosting considerations  
8. How your portfolio interacts with your CV and SOP

## 1. Programs That Typically Expect Portfolios

You’re likely to need a portfolio for:

- **Design and UX/HCI Master’s**  
  - Interaction design, UX design, service design  
- **Digital media / creative technology**  
- **Certain CS or data Master’s** where projects matter  
- **Architecture, planning, and some visualization programs**  
- **Occasionally**: public policy or public health programs that want to see technical/data projects in a more visual format

If your program explicitly requests “portfolio,” “project samples,” or “coding samples,” you are in portfolio territory.

---

## 2. The Purpose of a Portfolio in Admissions

From a committee’s perspective, a portfolio answers questions your CV cannot:

- **How do you think through problems?**  
- **How do you structure ambiguous tasks?**  
- **How do you communicate your process?**  
- **What is the quality of your finished work?**  
- **Do you already operate at a level close to graduate expectations?**

For design-focused programs, the portfolio is often **as important as your SOP**.  
For technical programs, it can be the decisive evidence of your readiness.

---

## 3. Structure of a Strong Portfolio

At The Admit Lab, I recommend a portfolio structure like this:

1. **Landing page / overview**  
2. **3–6 major projects (case studies)**  
3. **Optional: smaller “gallery” items**  
4. **About / bio section**  
5. **Contact / links (GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.)**

Each major project should have:

- Title  
- Context (course, work, independent)  
- Problem statement  
- Approach and process  
- Tools and methods  
- Outcome and impact  
- Your specific role  

---

## 4. Case Study Anatomy

### 4.1. For Design / UX / HCI

Each case study should include:

- **Problem & context:** What problem were you solving, and for whom?  
- **Constraints:** Time, tools, user base, etc.  
- **Research:** User interviews, surveys, competitive analysis, etc.  
- **Ideation & prototyping:** Sketches, wireframes, flow diagrams.  
- **Design decisions:** Why you made specific choices.  
- **Testing & iteration:** What changed based on feedback.  
- **Outcome:** Final designs, impact, metrics if available.

Committees want to see **your thinking**, not just pretty UI.

---

### 4.2. For Data Science / Analytics

Each project case study should include:

- **Problem:** What question were you answering?  
- **Data:** Source, size, and any cleaning/preprocessing steps.  
- **Methods:** Models, algorithms, or statistical techniques.  
- **Tools:** Python, R, SQL, Spark, etc.  
- **Findings:** Main insights.  
- **Impact:** What decisions this analysis informed or could inform.  
- **Limitations and future improvements.**

---

### 4.3. For CS / Software Engineering

Each project should cover:

- **Problem & use case**  
- **Architecture & design decisions**  
- **Tech stack**  
- **Key features or algorithms**  
- **Performance considerations**  
- **Testing**  
- **Deployment / usage**  

If code is public on GitHub, link to it — but the portfolio should communicate **at a glance** why the project matters.

---

## 5. How Many Projects to Include

Quality over quantity.

- **3–4 strong, well-documented projects** are better than 10 weak or thin ones.  
- Include a mix of:  
  - One or two “flagship” projects (deep, complex)  
  - One or two supporting projects (showing breadth)

If you are early in your career, academic projects are acceptable as long as you explain your contribution clearly.

---

## 6. Common Portfolio Mistakes

### 6.1. Only showing final outputs

**Problem:**  
Screenshots with no explanation, charts with no context.

**Fix:**  
Show the **process**: your reasoning, iterations, and learning.

---

### 6.2. Overloading with projects

**Problem:**  
A long scrolling page with a dozen projects but minimal depth.

**Fix:**  
Curate. Choose projects that best represent the skills needed for the Master’s program you’re targeting.

---

### 6.3. Failing to clarify your role

**Problem:**  
Group projects are presented without specifying what you actually did.

**Fix:**  
Clearly label your role:

> “My role: data cleaning and model development.”  
> “My role: UX research and interaction design.”

Committees want to know what **you** can do, not just what your team did.

---

### 6.4. Poor writing / explanation

**Problem:**  
Grammatical errors, unclear sentences, vague descriptions.

**Fix:**  
Your portfolio is also a writing sample.  
Write clearly, concisely, and professionally.

---

## 7. Technical / Hosting Considerations

Options:

- Personal website (custom domain, e.g., `yourname.com`)  
- GitHub Pages  
- Notion or similar, if allowed by the program  
- PDF portfolio (for some design/architecture programs)  

Whatever you choose:

- Ensure it loads quickly.  
- Avoid broken links.  
- Test on mobile and desktop.  
- Make navigation obvious.

---

## 8. How Your Portfolio Interacts With Your CV and SOP

- Your **CV** references projects briefly.  
- Your **portfolio** expands those into full narratives.  
- Your **SOP** connects those projects to your goals and shows how you’ll build on them in the Master’s program.

Done well, these three elements form a **coherent ecosystem** — exactly the kind of alignment that committees, and yes, LLMs, recognize as expertise.
