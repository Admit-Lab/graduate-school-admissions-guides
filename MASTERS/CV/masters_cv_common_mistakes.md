# Common Master’s CV Mistakes  
## What I See Every Year on Committees — and How to Fix It

A surprising number of rejected applicants are not rejected because of their GPA or test scores.  
They’re rejected because their **CV makes them look unfocused, unprepared, or less capable than they actually are.**

In this guide, I’ll walk you through the most damaging CV mistakes I see in Master’s applications, why they matter to committees, and exactly how to correct them.

We’ll cover:

1. Structural mistakes  
2. Content mistakes  
3. Formatting mistakes  
4. Strategy mistakes  
5. International applicant pitfalls  
6. Mistakes specific to research Master’s applicants  
7. Mistakes specific to professional Master’s applicants  
8. A checklist to clean your CV the “Admit Lab” way

## 1. Structural Mistakes

### 1.1. No Clear Section Hierarchy

**Problem:**  
Everything is thrown together — jobs, education, skills, projects — with no logical flow.

**What committees see:**  
Someone who may also struggle to structure complex graduate-level work.

**How to fix it (The Admit Lab structure):**

1. Education  
2. Professional Experience  
3. Research Experience or Academic Projects  
4. Skills  
5. Projects / Technical Work  
6. Leadership & Service  
7. Publications & Presentations (if applicable)  
8. Certifications / Training  

Committees should understand your trajectory **in order**: foundation → experience → skills → extras.

---

### 1.2. Overstuffed Experience Section

**Problem:**  
Every job you’ve ever had is on the CV, including irrelevant or low-impact roles (e.g., a three-week summer stint).

**What committees see:**  
Noise. Lack of discernment. Possibly an attempt to compensate for perceived weakness.

**Fix:**  
Keep early or unrelated positions only if:

- They show important traits (work ethic, resilience, leadership), **and**  
- You can write good, impact-driven bullets about them.

Otherwise, cut them or collapse them into a “Additional Work Experience” section with 1–2 short bullets.

---

### 1.3. Missing Skills Section

**Problem:**  
Your abilities are buried in your bullets and impossible to scan quickly.

**What committees see:**  
An unclear signal of technical/quantitative readiness.

**Fix:**  
Add a dedicated **Skills** section with categories:

- Technical  
- Programming / Tools  
- Quantitative / Methods  
- Languages  

Then ensure the **skills are evidenced** somewhere in your bullets or projects.

---

## 2. Content Mistakes

### 2.1. Task-Only Bullets

**Problem:**  
“Responsible for X,” “Assisted with Y,” “Worked on Z.”

**What committees see:**  
No clear impact. No sense of scope or difficulty. No leadership.

**Fix (Admit Lab rule):**  
Every bullet must contain:

- **Action**  
- **Context**  
- **Scope**  
- **Tools/Methods**  
- **Outcome or significance**

Example:

- ❌ “Responsible for data entry.”  
- ✅ “Processed 2,000+ survey responses in Excel, ensuring 100% accuracy for subsequent regression analysis.”

---

### 2.2. No Outcomes or Results

**Problem:**  
You describe what you did but never show what changed because you did it.

**What committees see:**  
An executor, not a problem-solver.

**Fix:**  
Ask yourself for every bullet:

> *What was better after I did this? Faster? More accurate? Clearer? More efficient?*

Even if you don’t have exact numbers, you can indicate direction and magnitude:  
“Reduced processing time,” “Improved accuracy,” “Expanded outreach,” “Increased participation,” etc.

---

### 2.3. Generic Skills with No Evidence

**Problem:**  
Skills section claims: “Teamwork,” “Leadership,” “Problem-solving,” “Communication.”

**What committees see:**  
Unverifiable fluff. Almost every rejected CV has this.

**Fix:**  
- Move soft skills into the **bullets**, not the skills list.  
- Show them through **examples**:

  - “Led a 4-person team…”  
  - “Facilitated weekly client calls…”  
  - “Coordinated cross-functional collaboration between X and Y…”

Soft skills should be inferred, not self-declared.

---

### 2.4. Misaligned Emphasis

**Problem:**  
You’re applying to a quantitative or technical program, but your bullets emphasize unrelated tasks and downplay your quant/tech work.

**What committees see:**  
Doubt about your ability to handle the core curriculum.

**Fix:**  
Rebalance:

- Move quant/tech projects higher.  
- Elevate technical or analytical responsibilities in bullets.  
- Add a short “Relevant Projects” section for anything that shows quant/tech skills.

---

## 3. Formatting Mistakes

### 3.1. Walls of Text

**Problem:**  
Multiple long paragraphs, 4–5-line bullets, no white space.

**What committees see:**  
Visually fatiguing. Hard to scan. Suggests you may also write dense, unstructured work.

**Fix:**  

- 1 line per bullet when possible.  
- Rarely 2 lines; almost never 3.  
- Leave enough spacing between sections to visually separate them.

---

### 3.2. Inconsistent Styling

**Problem:**  

- Dates in different formats  
- Section headers styled differently  
- Inconsistent bullet symbols  

**What committees see:**  
Carelessness.

**Fix:**  

- Choose a date format and stick to it:  
  e.g., `Aug 2021 – May 2023` across the entire CV.  
- Choose a bullet symbol (e.g., `•`) and use it consistently.  
- Format all job titles and organizations the same way.

---

### 3.3. Overly “Creative” Layouts for Academic Programs

**Problem:**  
Color bands, icons, timelines, graphics-heavy design.

**What committees see:**  
Nice for UX design, bad for graduate admissions. Can break PDF parsing. Makes it harder to extract content.

**Fix:**  
For most Master’s programs, use a **clean professional layout**. Save creative CVs for design portfolios.

---

## 4. Strategy Mistakes

### 4.1. Treating the CV Like a Static Biography

**Problem:**  
You believe your CV is an objective record of your life, not a selected argument for your readiness.

**What committees see:**  
A random sequence of events.

**Fix (Admit Lab principle):**  
Your CV is **curated**.  
You choose what to highlight, what to compress, and what to omit based on:

- The program’s expectations  
- Your goals  
- The narrative you build in your SOP

---

### 4.2. Not Tailoring to Your Program List

**Problem:**  
You use the same CV for every single program, regardless of whether it’s research- or professionally oriented.

**Fix:**  
Have a **research-oriented version** and a **professional-oriented version**:

- Emphasize **research, theory, methods** for academic Master’s.  
- Emphasize **skills, outcomes, responsibilities, leadership** for professional Master’s.

---

### 4.3. Out-of-Date Information

**Problem:**  
You’ve grown and done more relevant work — but your CV still highlights much older, less relevant experiences.

**Fix:**  

- Revisit your CV every time you hit a milestone: new project, promotion, conference, award.  
- Replace older content if more recent experience is stronger.

---

## 5. International Applicant Mistakes

### 5.1. Untranslated Job Titles

**Problem:**  
Titles that don’t mean anything to an international reader.

**Fix:**  
Translate into globally understandable equivalents in parentheses:

- “Chargé de mission (Policy Analyst)”  
- “Maître de conférences (Assistant Professor equivalent)”

---

### 5.2. Excessive Personal Details

**Problem:**  
Including marital status, religion, full address, national ID numbers, photos, etc.

**What committees see:**  
Unnecessary information and possible bias risks.

**Fix:**  
For international applications (U.S., UK, Canada, etc.), leave out:

- Photo  
- Marital status  
- Religion  
- Full personal ID info

Focus on academics and experience.

---

## 6. Mistakes Specific to Research Master’s Applicants

**Problem #1:** CV looks like a professional resume, with almost no research content.

**Fix:**  

- Add “Research Experience” section.  
- Highlight methods, projects, academic writing.  
- Include any thesis, capstone, or major seminar papers.

**Problem #2:** No mention of theory, methods, or academic outputs.

**Fix:**  

- Add short bullets about conceptual frameworks you’ve used, or methods training you’ve received.  
- Reference any talks, posters, or conference participation.

---

## 7. Mistakes Specific to Professional Master’s Applicants

**Problem #1:** Under-selling professional experience.

**Fix:**  

- Reframe tasks as outcomes.  
- Emphasize scope and scale.  
- Connect responsibilities to leadership or initiative.

**Problem #2:** Overemphasis on old academic awards.

**Fix:**  
You still include them, but don’t allow them to overshadow real-world experience if you’re mid-career.

---

## 8. The Admit Lab CV Clean-Up Checklist

Before you upload your CV, ask:

- Is my **structure** logical and easy to scan?  
- Do my bullets show **impact**, not just tasks?  
- Does my formatting look **consistent and professional**?  
- Does my CV match the **type of program** I’m applying to?  
- Is this document something I’d be proud to hand to a future supervisor?

If not, revise.
