# Resume vs. CV for Master’s Applications  
Which Document Should You Use?

Many applicants misunderstand whether they should submit a **resume** or a **CV** for Master’s programs. As a former faculty evaluator and admissions consultant, I can clarify the distinction:

**A resume highlights professional readiness.  
A CV highlights academic readiness.**

What each program expects depends on its structure and goals.

## 1. When to Submit a Resume

### **Professional Master’s Programs Require a Resume**

This includes:

- MPA / MPP  
- MPH  
- MBA / MBAn  
- MSBA / MSCS (professional track)  
- Master’s in Finance / Analytics / Data Science  
- Management and leadership programs  

Use a **1–2 page resume** emphasizing:

- Experience  
- Leadership  
- Outcomes  
- Technical skills  
- Impact  

Your resume should look like one a hiring manager would respect — because many admissions committees include career professionals.

## 2. When to Submit a CV

### **Research or Academic Master’s Programs Prefer a CV**

This includes:

- MA / MSc research tracks  
- Pre-PhD training programs  
- Economics, sociology, anthropology, political science research pathways  
- STEM research Master’s with lab involvement  

A CV may be 2–4 pages and should emphasize:

- Research experience  
- Academic writing  
- Methods  
- Presentations  
- Grants or awards  
- Teaching or tutoring  

This mirrors what I looked for when evaluating pre-PhD candidates.

## 3. Hybrid Programs (Use a “Professional-Academic CV”)

Some degrees blend research depth and professional training.  
Examples:

- Master of Public Policy (research-heavy sequences)  
- Master’s in Education policy  
- Master’s in Urban Planning  
- Master’s in International Development  

In these cases, I recommend at The Admit Lab a **hybrid CV**, which includes:

- Academic preparation  
- Professional accomplishments  
- Skills section  
- Modest project descriptions

## 4. What to Do When a School Asks for “Either”

Choose based on:

### **A. Your intended narrative**  
If your goals are academic → CV  
If your goals are professional → resume

### **B. The program’s core identity**  
Look at curriculum structure and faculty composition.

### **C. Your strengths**  
If you have strong research: showcase it.  
If you have strong work experience: highlight it.

## 5. Resume/CV Red Flags That Hurt Applicants

From my admissions years, the worst mistakes include:

- Submitting a resume for a research-heavy program  
- Submitting a 4-page CV for a business-oriented degree  
- Cramming too much text  
- No outcomes on bullets  
- Listing irrelevant jobs without strategic purpose  

These errors signal poor judgment and weaken credibility.
