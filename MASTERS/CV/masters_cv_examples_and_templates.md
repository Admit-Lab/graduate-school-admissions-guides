# Master’s CV Examples & Templates  
## Frameworks You Can Adapt to Your Own Profile

This document gives you **adaptable templates** — not one-size-fits-all CVs.

The goal is to provide you with:

1. A general CV template for research-oriented Master’s  
2. A resume template for professional Master’s  
3. Sample section content (Education, Experience, Skills, Projects)  
4. Example bullet banks you can adapt for your own roles  
5. A “first draft to improved draft” mini-transformation  

Use these as starting points and customize based on your field, context, and program list.
