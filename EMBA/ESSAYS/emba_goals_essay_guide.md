# EMBA Goals Essay Guide  
How to Articulate Executive-Level Purpose

The EMBA goals essay answers three questions:

1. Where are you going?  
2. Why can’t you get there without an EMBA?  
3. Why this program?  

This is not an MBA pivot story — it is an **executive trajectory narrative**.

## 🔷 1. Short-Term Goal (12–24 Months)
Should reflect:
- A specific role transition (Director → VP)  
- Expanded enterprise responsibility  
- A new strategic mandate  
- Geographic or market expansion  

---

## 🔷 2. Long-Term Goal (3–5+ Years)
Should reflect:
- Organizational transformation  
- Senior executive responsibilities  
- Board participation  
- Industry-level impact  

Avoid vague aspirations:
> “I want to be a better leader.”
