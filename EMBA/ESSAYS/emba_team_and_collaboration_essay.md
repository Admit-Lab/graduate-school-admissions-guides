# EMBA Team & Collaboration Essay Guide  
How to Show You Are Ready for a Cohort-Based Executive Program

Most EMBA programs ask a question about teamwork or collaboration because the cohort structure is central to the experience.

Committees want to know:
- How you work with senior peers  
- How you handle conflict  
- How you communicate upwards and across organizations  
- Whether you elevate teams rather than dominate them  

---

## 🔷 1. Choose a Situation With Genuine Complexity  
Examples:
- Multi-stakeholder alignment  
- Managing conflict between senior leaders  
- Leading a cross-cultural team  
- Negotiating priorities across departments  

Avoid simple “I led a small project team” examples.

## 🔷 2. Show Executive-Level Collaboration Skills  
Focus on:
- Influence without authority  
- Strategic communication  
- Relationship management  
- Empathy and perspective-taking  
- Facilitating alignment under ambiguity  

---

## 🔷 3. Demonstrate Organizational Impact  
Examples:
- Faster project delivery  
- Reduced risk or conflict  
- Improved team cohesion  
- Successful change adoption  

---

## 🔷 4. Connect It to the EMBA Cohort Learning Model  
Show you understand the program’s structure:
> “Given the peer-driven nature of the EMBA classroom, I bring an ability to collaborate with senior leaders across functions and industries…”

This demonstrates maturity and readiness.
