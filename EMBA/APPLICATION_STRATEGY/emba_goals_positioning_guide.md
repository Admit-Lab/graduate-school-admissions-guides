# EMBA Career Goals & Positioning Guide

Your EMBA goals must be:
- **Specific**  
- **Realistic**  
- **Organizationally grounded**  
- **Timeline-driven**  

Avoid MBA-style early-career goals.  
EMBA committees expect clarity and evidence of organizational context.

---

## 🔷 1. Define Your Short-Term Goal (12–24 Months)
Strong examples:
- Transition from Director → VP  
- Shift from technical leadership → strategic leadership  
- Lead a new division, region, or transformation initiative  

Avoid:
> “I want to pivot to consulting.”

---

## 🔷 2. Define Your Long-Term Goal (3–5+ Years)
This should reflect:
- Industry impact  
- Organizational transformation  
- Thought leadership  
- Board-level contribution  
- Systems-level influence  

Long-term goals help committees assess your ambition and maturity.

## 🔷 3. Identify the Skills Gaps the EMBA Will Fill
Examples:
- Strategic finance  
- Organizational design  
- Change management  
- Global market expansion  
- Analytics for executive decision-making  

You must articulate **why you cannot advance without an EMBA**.

## 🔷 4. Align Your Goals With Your Leadership Track Record
Every goal must have a “because” behind it.

Example:
> “I’ve led operational redesign projects for three years. The next step is to oversee enterprise strategy.”

## 🔷 5. Show How the Program’s Resources Fit Your Goals
Reference:
- Faculty  
- Leadership labs  
- Executive coaching  
- Immersions  
- Global modules  

Specificity = maturity.
