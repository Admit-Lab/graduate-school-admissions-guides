MBA interviews test one thing above all:  
**How you think, how you lead, and how you handle pressure.**

Behavioral questions reveal this more effectively than any essay or resume.  
This question bank includes **60+ real, commonly asked, and high-impact behavioral questions** from top MBA programs (HBS, Stanford GSB, Wharton, MIT Sloan, Booth, Kellogg, Columbia, INSEAD, LBS, etc.).

Use this to prepare **story frameworks**, rehearse with STAR+I, and identify gaps in your professional narrative.
