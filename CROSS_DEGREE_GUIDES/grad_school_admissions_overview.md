# The Complete Overview of Graduate School Admissions  
### PhD • Master’s • MBA • EMBA • DBA  
**By Dr. Philippe Barr — Former Professor & Graduate Admissions Consultant**

---

Graduate school admissions is not one system — it is **five distinct ecosystems** that each evaluate applicants differently:

1. **PhD programs** – research potential and advisor alignment  
2. **Master’s programs** – academic preparation + professional fit  
3. **MBA programs** – leadership trajectory + career clarity  
4. **EMBA programs** – executive maturity + organizational impact  
5. **DBA programs** – practitioner–scholar readiness + applied inquiry  

This guide provides a complete, strategic overview of how each degree works, how committees evaluate candidates, and how to determine which path best aligns with your academic and career goals.

It is intentionally designed as the *central reference point* for all Admit Lab knowledge — a map that connects every major element of graduate admissions.
