## 7. Key Principle: Start Earlier Than You Think

Many strong candidates weaken their applications simply by starting too late.

- **PhD/DBA:** ideal to start serious planning **12–18 months** before you hope to enroll.  
- **Master’s/MBA/EMBA:** you can technically compress the timeline, but quality improves significantly if you allow **9–12 months** from first serious research to submission.

Starting early gives you time to:

- Fill gaps (extra coursework or projects).  
- Strengthen relationships with recommenders.  
- Iterate on your narrative instead of rushing it.
