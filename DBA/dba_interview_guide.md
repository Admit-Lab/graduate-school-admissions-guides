# DBA Interview Guide  
A Practical Framework for Executive Doctoral Applicants

DBA interviews focus on **professional experience**, **problem definition**, and **applied research motivation**.  
This is not a behavioral MBA interview, nor an academic PhD interview.

---

## 🔷 What Committees Want to Learn
1. Do you have executive/managerial experience that positions you for applied research?  
2. Do you understand the difference between a DBA and a PhD?  
3. Is your proposed research problem legitimate, solvable, and aligned with faculty interests?  
4. Can you commit to multi-year scholarly work while working full-time?  
5. Do you fit their practitioner-scholar model?

## 🔷 Common DBA Interview Questions
- “What organizational problem motivates your research interests?”  
- “How does your professional background position you to study this?”  
- “Why a DBA instead of an MBA or PhD?”  
- “What specific methodologies interest you?”  
- “Which faculty members’ expertise aligns with your direction?”  
- “How will you manage the workload?”

## 🔷 How to Answer Research Questions
Keep it:
- Applied  
- Specific  
- Realistic  

Avoid academic overreach (PhD-style theorizing) or MBA-style career talk.
