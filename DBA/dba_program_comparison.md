# How to Compare DBA Programs  
### Research Expectations • Executive Outcomes • Program Design  
**By Dr. Philippe Barr — Former Professor & Graduate Admissions Consultant**

---

Choosing a Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) program requires a fundamentally different evaluation framework than choosing an MBA, EMBA, or even a PhD.

A DBA sits at the intersection of:
- **executive leadership**,  
- **applied research**, and  
- **organizational impact**.  

Your goal is to become a **practitioner–scholar** — someone who generates insights that reshape practice while contributing to scholarly understanding.

To choose the right DBA program, you must analyze the following dimensions with precision:
- research rigor  
- dissertation expectations  
- faculty alignment  
- industry relevance  
- time-to-completion  
- level of academic support  
- cohort composition  
- post-degree career pathways  

This guide provides a complete comparison framework to help you identify which programs align with your goals, leadership identity, and research aspirations.

# 🔷 1. The Three Types of DBA Programs (Know Which You're Choosing)

Nearly all DBA programs fall into **three categories**, even if they use different branding.

Understanding this classification is essential.

---

## **TYPE 1 — Research-Intensive DBA (Closest to a PhD)**
Examples:
- Harvard DBA (historically)  
- Case Western Reserve Weatherhead  
- Georgia State University J. Mack Robinson  
- University of Manchester (AMBS) DBA  
- Grenoble DBA  

Characteristics:
- high theory engagement  
- strong methodological expectations  
- peer-reviewed publication potential  
- faculty-supervised dissertation  
- advanced quantitative or qualitative research training  

Ideal for:
- senior professionals planning to teach at the graduate level  
- executives who want to publish  
- practitioner–scholars seeking consulting frameworks  
- leaders who want to influence industry from a research standpoint  

---

## **TYPE 2 — Applied DBA (Balanced: research + executive practice)**
Examples:
- Pepperdine Graziadio DBA  
- Drexel LeBow DBA  
- Rollins Crummer DBA  
- Warwick Business School DBA  

Characteristics:
- research required but less theory-intensive  
- focus on organizational problems  
- methods training balanced with practitioner frameworks  
- dissertation often applied, not theoretical  

Ideal for:
- executives solving major organizational problems  
- leaders who want a rigorous but practical degree  
- practitioner-consultants  
- executives transitioning into academic–industry hybrid roles  

---

## **TYPE 3 — Executive DBA (Practice-first, research-light)**
Examples:
- Paris–Dauphine DBA  
- Temple Fox Executive DBA  
- Pace Lubin DBA  

Characteristics:
- strongest emphasis on leadership practice  
- shorter methodological depth  
- professional portfolio or applied capstone possible  
- dissertation often narrower in research scope  

Ideal for:
- executives prioritizing leadership enhancement  
- senior leaders wanting doctoral-level credentials  
- individuals less focused on peer-reviewed academia

# 🔷 2. The 10 Criteria Every DBA Applicant Must Compare

Use this table-like framework when evaluating programs.

---

## **1. Research Expectations**
Questions to ask:
- How many research methods courses?  
- Are you required to conduct original empirical research?  
- Is publication encouraged or required?  
- How rigorous is the dissertation model?  

Higher research expectations = more credibility in academia and consulting.

---

## **2. Faculty Alignment**
The #1 predictor of DBA success.

Look for:
- supervisors with experience in applied research  
- expertise aligned with your topic  
- availability for one-on-one guidance  
- scholars engaged in practitioner-focused inquiry  

A strong supervisor is worth more than program ranking.

---

## **3. Dissertation Model**
DBA programs use different models:

- **traditional dissertation**  
- **three-paper model**  
- **applied capstone**  
- **portfolio of practice-based research**  

Choose based on:
- your time capacity  
- your research comfort  
- your career goals  

---

## **4. Methodological Training**
Key question:

### **Will this program teach you the methods you need to execute your research proposal?**

Look for:
- qualitative methods  
- quantitative methods  
- mixed methods  
- data analytics (if relevant)  
- case study design  
- interviewing techniques  
- applied statistical modeling  

Programs vary widely — do not assume all DBAs are equivalent.

---

## **5. Executive Relevance**
Does the curriculum intersect with:
- strategy  
- innovation  
- leadership  
- organizational behavior  
- digital transformation  
- ESG and sustainability  
- change management  

A program with purely academic seminars may not serve practice-focused leaders.

---

## **6. Cohort Composition**
You want:
- senior leaders  
- directors  
- VPs  
- founders  
- public-sector executives  

Diverse industries = broader learning.

Programs with early-career applicants are not truly DBA-level.

---

## **7. Time-to-Completion + Flexibility**
Most DBAs take **3–4 years**.

Beware of programs promising “2-year completion” — this often indicates:
- weak research expectations  
- light methodology  
- compressed supervision  

Flexibility matters for executives:
- weekend or modular format  
- online + residency model  
- asynchronous coursework  

---

## **8. Accreditation**
This determines global recognition.

Top accreditations:
- AACSB  
- EQUIS  
- AMBA  

At least one is recommended for leadership or consulting career paths.

---

## **9. Teaching and Academia Opportunities**
If you want to teach:
- does the program offer pedagogical training?  
- opportunities to guest lecture?  
- faculty mentorship?  
- publishing pathways?  

Research-intensive DBAs offer stronger teaching pipelines.

---

## **10. Brand Power and Network**
Important but not decisive.

Ask:
- Does the brand open consulting doors?  
- Do alumni hold senior roles?  
- How integrated is the DBA community within the business school?  

Brand matters more for:
- consulting  
- board seats  
- academic adjunct roles  

---

# 🔷 3. How to Decide Which DBA Type Fits *Your* Goals

Use this section as a decision matrix.

---

## **Choose a Research-Intensive DBA if:**
- You want to publish  
- You want to teach at the university level  
- You enjoy theory and research methodology  
- You want to become a recognized expert in your field  
- You plan to build consulting frameworks based on research  

---

## **Choose an Applied DBA if:**
- You want to solve a major organizational problem  
- You want both rigor and practicality  
- You need a dissertation grounded in your company or industry  
- You want research that supports consulting or advisory work  

---

## **Choose an Executive DBA if:**
- Your goal is leadership development  
- You need maximum flexibility  
- You want a doctoral credential without heavy research training  
- Your primary identity is senior executive, not researcher

# 🔷 4. Comparing DBA Programs Using a 12-Point Rubric

You can rate each program 1–5 on the following:

1. Research rigor  
2. Methodological depth  
3. Faculty alignment  
4. Organizational relevance  
5. Dissertation quality  
6. Cohort seniority  
7. Program flexibility  
8. Industry reputation  
9. Accreditation level  
10. Academic teaching opportunities  
11. Consulting applicability  
12. Supervisor support quality  

A score of:
- **50+** = strong fit  
- **40–49** = good fit  
- **35–39** = acceptable but consider alternatives  
- **<35** = weak alignment

# 🔷 6. Avoid These Common DBA Selection Mistakes

🚫 **Choosing based on tuition alone**  
Cheap DBAs = often low rigor.

🚫 **Choosing based on brand without checking research depth**  
Prestige ≠ methodological training.

🚫 **Choosing a program that cannot support your research topic**  
Faculty alignment determines dissertation success.

🚫 **Ignoring supervisor availability**  
Some programs accept far more students than faculty can supervise.

🚫 **Underestimating workload**  
A DBA is not “MBA part 2” — it is doctoral-level study.

🚫 **Choosing a program misaligned with your identity**  
Academic-focused applicants should avoid executive-only DBAs.  
Executives not wanting research should avoid research-intensive DBAs.
