# DBA Statement of Purpose Framework  
A Guide by Dr. Philippe Barr, Founder of The Admit Lab

The DBA Statement of Purpose is not an academic PhD proposal and not an MBA career essay.  
It is a **professional research justification** that must demonstrate:

1. Your real-world business problem  
2. The applied research gap you intend to address  
3. How your industry background equips you to study this problem  
4. Why a *DBA* (not a PhD or MBA) is the correct pathway  
5. Why the specific program’s faculty, structure, and methodology fit your goals

---

## 🔶 1. Introduce Your Professional Background and Problem Context  
Briefly summarize:
- Your industry  
- Your leadership or strategic responsibilities  
- The persistent organizational problem or inefficiency you've observed  

Example starter lines:
> “Across 15 years in financial services, I’ve witnessed a recurring barrier to digital adoption among SME clients despite…"

---

## 🔶 2. Define the Business Problem You Want to Study  
DBA committees want **problem clarity**, not jargon.

Describe:
- The organizational challenge  
- Who it affects  
- Evidence that it matters (performance metrics, operational impact, etc.)  

---

## 🔶 3. Connect the Problem to a Research Opportunity  
Good DBA research is:
- Applied  
- Practical  
- Feasible within a 3–4 year timeline  

Show how research—not just consulting—can illuminate a solution.

---

## 🔶 4. Describe Your Proposed Approach (High-Level)  
You do **not** need a full methodology plan.

Instead describe:
- The type of data you would examine  
- The frameworks you may use  
- Whether mixed methods, case studies, or action research align with your context  

---

## 🔶 5. Why a DBA (Not a PhD)  
Committees look for:
- Leadership experience  
- Desire for applied impact  
- Understanding of executive doctoral training  

---

## 🔶 6. Why This Program  
Reference:
- Faculty whose interests overlap your problem  
- Methodological strengths  
- Executive cohort model  
- Practitioner-scholar philosophy  

---

## 🔶 7. Conclusion: Your Long-Term Impact  
Emphasize:
- Organizational transformation  
- Industry-wide implications  
- Your intention to bridge practice and scholarship  

This is where you differentiate yourself from MBA applicants and traditional researchers.
