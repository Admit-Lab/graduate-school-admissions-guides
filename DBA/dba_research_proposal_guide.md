# How to Develop a DBA Research Proposal  
### Practitioner–Scholar Integration • Research Design • Organizational Impact  
**By Dr. Philippe Barr — Former Professor & Graduate Admissions Consultant**

---

A Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) is fundamentally different from both a PhD and an MBA.

- A **PhD** trains academic researchers to contribute to theory.  
- An **MBA** trains managers to apply existing tools in practice.  
- A **DBA** develops *practitioner–scholars* who generate new knowledge through rigorous inquiry grounded in real organizational problems.

Your research proposal must demonstrate that you:

1. Understand a concrete business challenge at a strategic level  
2. Can translate that challenge into a researchable problem  
3. Are prepared to use scholarly methods to investigate it  
4. Can contribute insights that matter to both academia and industry  

This guide provides the complete framework I use with executives applying to top DBA programs in the U.S., UK, and Europe.

# 🔷 1. What DBA Committees Look For in a Research Proposal

DBA programs are evaluating **four core competencies**:

## **1. Practitioner Insight**
You must bring a real organizational problem — not a conceptual interest.

Examples of real practitioner problems:

- Ineffective digital transformation across multi-unit organizations  
- Misalignment between strategic goals and performance metrics  
- Talent retention failures in hybrid or global teams  
- Predictive analytics not being adopted by frontline managers  
- Unclear ROI for ESG initiatives  
- Leadership bottlenecks during rapid scaling  

Your proposal must show you understand the complexities behind the problem.

---

## **2. Researchability**
The admissions committee must see that your problem can be studied through:

- data  
- established research methods  
- theory  
- measurable outcomes  

Vague themes like “leadership,” “innovation,” or “AI” must be narrowed into a **researchable question**.

---

## **3. Scholarly Orientation**
You do *not* need to be a researcher yet — but you must show:

- familiarity with relevant frameworks  
- ability to engage with academic literature  
- intellectual curiosity  
- awareness of methodological options  

They are evaluating your “trainability” as a scholar.

---

## **4. Potential Contribution**
Your study must add value to:

- your organization  
- your industry  
- the scholarly body of knowledge  

A DBA is applied research with theoretical depth.

# 🔷 2. The DBA Research Proposal Structure (8 Essential Sections)

Your proposal should follow this standard DBA format:

---

## **1. Practitioner Problem Context**
Describe the current challenge in *your* organization or industry.

You must demonstrate a high-level understanding of:
- the business environment  
- stakeholders  
- historical factors  
- the consequences of the problem  
- why now is the critical moment  

**Goal:** Show you understand the *real-world complexity* behind the issue.

---

## **2. Problem Statement**
Clarify the exact issue you want to investigate.

Use this formula:

### **“Despite [organizational initiative/effort], [core issue] continues to undermine [strategic outcome], suggesting gaps in understanding regarding [variable/mechanism].”**

Examples:

- Despite significant investment in analytics tools, adoption among mid-level managers remains low.  
- Despite leadership training initiatives, cross-functional teams still struggle with execution discipline.  
- Despite hybrid work protocols, employee engagement scores continue to decline.  

Your problem statement should reveal:
- a gap  
- a tension  
- an unresolved challenge  

---

## **3. Purpose of the Study**
This is the *scholarly* articulation of what your research intends to accomplish.

Use this structure:

### **“The purpose of this study is to examine/explore/evaluate [phenomenon] in order to understand [relationship/mechanism] and generate insights that inform [organizational/practical application].”**

Examples:
- Examine the drivers of analytics adoption in large enterprises  
- Explore leadership behaviors that influence innovation in regulated industries  
- Evaluate how hybrid work structures affect team cohesion and productivity  

---

## **4. Research Questions**
DBA research questions must be:
- specific  
- investigable  
- grounded in practice  
- theoretically meaningful  

Examples:

### **Leadership & Change**
- How do middle managers interpret strategic directives during digital transformation?  
- What leadership behaviors support cross-functional innovation during regulatory constraints?

### **Analytics & Decision-Making**
- What organizational factors influence adoption of predictive analytics among decision-makers?  
- How does analytics literacy shape the quality of strategic decisions?

### **Human Capital**
- What factors drive retention among high-performing employees in hybrid teams?  

### **Operations & Strategy**
- How do misaligned KPIs contribute to execution breakdowns in scaling organizations?

Aim for 1–3 research questions.

---

## **5. Literature Foundations**
You’re not expected to write a full literature review — just demonstrate:

- you know relevant theories  
- you can articulate how they relate to your problem  
- you understand the scholarly landscape  

Examples of frameworks to reference:

- **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)**  
- **Transformational Leadership Theory**  
- **Institutional Theory**  
- **Dynamic Capabilities**  
- **Resource-Based View (RBV)**  
- **Sociotechnical Systems Theory**  
- **Job Demands–Resources Model (JD-R)**  
- **Sensemaking Theory**  

You only need short paragraphs per concept explaining:

- what the theory says  
- why it matters  
- how it connects to your problem  

---

## **6. Proposed Methodology**
DBA programs expect:

- realistic methods  
- clear rationale  
- alignment between method and research question  

Methods commonly used in DBA dissertations:

### **Qualitative**
- semi-structured interviews  
- thematic analysis  
- case studies  
- focus groups  
- organizational document analysis  

### **Quantitative**
- surveys  
- regression analysis  
- hierarchical models  
- experimental designs (when possible)  

### **Mixed Methods**
- qualitative exploration + quantitative validation  
- surveys + interviews  
- data analytics + narrative inquiry  

State:

- why the method is appropriate  
- what data you expect to access  
- your planned unit of analysis  

---

## **7. Expected Contributions**
Your proposal must clearly state:

### **Practical Contributions**
Examples:
- improving analytics adoption  
- strengthening leadership pipelines  
- optimizing hybrid work structures  
- building evidence-based change strategies  

### **Scholarly Contributions**
Examples:
- extending understanding of technology adoption in mature organizations  
- refining leadership models in regulated industries  
- identifying new predictors of employee engagement  

Both are required.

---

## **8. Feasibility & Access**
Committees want to know:

- Do you have access to data?  
- Can you interview people?  
- Do you have insider knowledge?  
- Are timelines realistic?  

If you cannot access your current organization, propose:

- industry-wide study  
- publicly available datasets  
- cross-company interviews  

Feasibility is a major evaluation factor.

# 🔷 3. How to Develop a Strong DBA Research Idea (Step-by-Step)

## Step 1 — Identify a business problem you personally encounter
Not a theoretical interest or buzzword trend.

Ask yourself:
- What slows down execution in your organization?  
- What frustrates you as a leader?  
- What do teams struggle to adopt?  
- Where do KPIs fail to drive behavior?  
- What leadership gaps create friction?  

This becomes the anchor.

---

## Step 2 — Ask: “What don’t we understand yet?”
This is the research gap.

Signs of a research gap:
- no consensus  
- contradictory approaches  
- inconsistent results  
- large investments with unclear outcomes  

Your research question lives here.

---

## Step 3 — Map potential theoretical frameworks
Choose 2–4 theories that help explain your issue.

This shows scholarly orientation.

---

## Step 4 — Select a method you can actually execute
Don’t propose randomized experiments unless you can run them.

Most DBA applicants use:
- interviews  
- surveys  
- archival data  
- organizational datasets  

Be realistic.

---

## Step 5 — Write a 1-sentence study purpose
This will shape the rest.
