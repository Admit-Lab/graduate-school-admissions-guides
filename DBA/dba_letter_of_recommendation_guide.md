# DBA Letters of Recommendation Guide  
What Strong Referees Must Demonstrate

A strong DBA letter must discuss:

1. Leadership capability  
2. Strategic insight  
3. Ability to diagnose organizational problems  
4. Writing and communication skill  
5. Intellectual maturity  
6. Capacity to complete a doctoral-level project  

Unlike PhD letters, DBA letters may come from:
- CEOs  
- Direct supervisors  
- Cross-functional partners  
- Clients or board members  

Academic letters are optional unless your academic record is old or weak.

## 🔶 What Weakens a DBA Letter
- Purely behavioral descriptions  
- Overly “MBA-style: hardworking, team player”  
- No mention of intellectual capability  
- No examples tied to research readiness

Provide:
- Your SOP draft

- A project you led that required analysis or reflection  
- Deadlines and submission instructions
