# The PhD Post-Acceptance Guide  
### How to Navigate Offers, Advisors, Funding, Relocation, and Your First-Year Plan  
**By Dr. Philippe Barr — The Admit Lab**

---

Most applicants focus entirely on *getting in* — but the period **after you receive an offer** is just as strategically important.  
This guide explains *exactly* what to do once you’re admitted, how to interpret your offer, how to communicate with faculty, and how to prepare yourself for success long before the first day of the program.

This is the guide I wish every incoming PhD student had.

# 🔷 1. Understanding Your Offer Letter  
Every offer has three critical components:

### **1. Funding Package**
Look for:
- guaranteed years of funding  
- stipend amount  
- TA/RA obligations  
- summer support (very important)  
- tuition + fee waivers  
- health insurance  

A strong offer includes:
- 5–6 years guaranteed funding (U.S.)  
- 3–4 years + dissertation-year options (UK/EU)  

If your offer does *not* mention summer funding: **assume it is NOT included.**

### **2. Advisor Assignment (U.S. vs UK/EU)**

#### **In the U.S.:**
- Advisor is often *not final* until after coursework.  
- The letter may list a “provisional advisor” — this is normal.

#### **In the UK/EU:**
- Advisor *is* assigned at admission.  
- This decision determines 80% of your trajectory.  
- If concerns exist, raise them **before** accepting.

### **3. Program Expectations**
Look for:
- teaching load (TA hours per semester)  
- lab rotation requirements  
- milestone deadlines (qualifying exams, proposal, etc.)  
- publication expectations  

You should save the offer letter indefinitely — it is a binding agreement.

# 🔷 2. How to Compare Multiple Offers (Evidence-Based Method)
Use a 5-category scoring model:

### **1. Advisor Quality (40%)**
The single most predictive factor in PhD completion and success is your advisor.

Evaluate:
- mentorship style  
- publication track record  
- funding stability  
- graduation outcomes of previous students  
- alignment with your topic  

### **2. Research Environment (20%)**  
Consider:
- lab culture  
- department support  
- cohort strength  
- available datasets/resources  

### **3. Funding Stability (20%)**
Higher stipends do not always mean higher *quality of life*.  
Cost of living matters.

### **4. Program Prestige (10%)**  
Prestige matters **less** for PhDs than for MBAs — but:
- placements  
- advisor reputation  
- field standing  
do influence academic careers.

### **5. Life Considerations (10%)**
Where you live for 5–7 years *matters*:
- family  
- visa conditions  
- mental health support  
- city affordability  

Make your decision based on **fit**, not ego.

# 🔷 3. Should You Negotiate Your PhD Offer?
PhD offers are not like industry jobs.

### **You can ethically negotiate when:**
- you have multiple funded offers  
- you are choosing between comparable programs  
- another program offers a substantially higher stipend  
- you have childcare or relocation needs  

### **You should NOT negotiate:**
- if your offer is standard for that program  
- if the department explicitly forbids adjustments  
- by threatening or leveraging faculty inappropriately  

### **How to negotiate professionally:**
