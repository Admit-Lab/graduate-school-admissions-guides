# Understanding PhD Funding  
### Fully Funded Offers • Fellowships • Stipends • Hidden Realities  
**By Dr. Philippe Barr — Former Professor & Graduate Admissions Consultant**

---

Funding is one of the most misunderstood elements of the PhD application process — and one of the most decisive.

Applicants often ask:

- “What does *fully funded* actually mean?”  
- “Will I be paid enough to live on?”  
- “What’s the difference between a fellowship and an assistantship?”  
- “Do some programs fund you better than others?”  
- “Do international students get the same funding?”  
- “What hidden costs should I expect?”  

This guide explains everything you need to know about PhD funding in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and the UK — including the realities programs *don’t* advertise.

# 🔷 1. What “Fully Funded” Actually Means  
(And Why It Confuses Applicants)

A “fully funded” PhD package typically includes:

### ✔ 100% Tuition Remission  
Your tuition is waived — you do *not* pay the university.

### ✔ Annual Stipend  
This is your living allowance, paid:  
- monthly (common),  
- biweekly (STEM programs), or  
- quarterly (some humanities programs).

### ✔ Health Insurance  
Nearly all reputable programs provide coverage, though quality varies widely.

### ✔ Teaching or Research Appointment  
Most funding packages require either:  
- **TA (Teaching Assistantship)**  
- **RA (Research Assistantship)**  
- **GA (Graduate Assistantship)**  

A small portion of students receive fellowships with **no work obligations**.

### ✔ Duration of Funding  
Standard range: **5–6 years** for PhDs in the U.S.

Humanities often guarantee 5 years; STEM programs often promise **funding until degree completion** via RAships.

# 🔷 2. Types of Funding — From Most Desirable to Most Restrictive

### **1. University Fellowships (Best)**  
No teaching, no research obligations.  
You are paid simply to do your research.

Often awarded to:
- top-ranked applicants  
- diversity fellows  
- those with external fellowships  

Examples:
- NSF GRFP  
- NDSEG  
- Ford Foundation  
- Fulbright  
- Rhodes  
- Presidential Fellowships  

---

### **2. Research Assistantships (RAship)**  
Funded by a professor’s grant.

Pros:
- strong advisor alignment  
- predictable schedule  
- research directly contributes to dissertation  

Cons:
- you depend on your advisor’s funding stability  

---

### **3. Teaching Assistantships (TAship)**  
You assist with undergraduate courses.

Pros:
- transferable teaching experience  
- funding is often guaranteed for multiple years  

Cons:
- time-consuming  
- variable workload depending on department  

---

### **4. Graduate Assistantships (GAship)**  
Non-research work (administration, labs, programming support).

Pros:
- stable  
- good for students without strong research experience  

Cons:
- may not align with dissertation goals  

---

# 🔷 3. Stipend Levels — What You’ll Actually Earn (U.S.)

Stipends vary dramatically by field and location.

### **High-Stipend Programs (Typically $35,000–$45,000/year)**  
Often in STEM or elite private universities:
- MIT  
- Stanford  
- Caltech  
- Princeton  
- Berkeley (STEM)  
- Carnegie Mellon  

### **Mid-Stipend Programs ($26,000–$34,000/year)**  
Typical for:
- social sciences  
- many R1 universities  
- funded professional-school PhDs (Education, Public Policy)  

### **Lower-Stipend Programs ($19,000–$25,000/year)**  
Common in:
- humanities  
- smaller private institutions  
- state schools in low-cost cities  

### Reality Check  
Stipends rarely adjust fully for cost of living.

A $38,000 stipend in NYC = tight.  
A $28,000 stipend in Iowa = comfortable.

---

# 🔷 4. Are International Students Funded?

### ✔ U.S. PhD programs  
International students **receive the same funding packages** as domestic students **in nearly all fully funded programs**.

Exceptions:
- some state-funded programs have limited slots  
- certain fellowships are U.S.-citizen only  

### ✔ Canada  
International students are funded but sometimes:
- pay higher fees, or  
- receive slightly reduced stipends  

### ✔ UK & Europe  
Varies drastically:  
- UK often underfunded unless you get a Studentship or external scholarship  
- Europe frequently funds all PhD students as employees (Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland)

# 🔷 5. The Hidden Costs of PhD Funding (Programs Rarely Tell You This)

### 💰 **1. Fees Are NOT Always Covered**  
Many universities charge:
- student fees  
- registration fees  
- technology fees  
- healthcare co-pays  

Estimated annual cost: **$800–$2,500**.

---

### 💰 **2. Taxes Vary**
- Fellowship income may be taxable.  
- International students may owe treaty-exempt taxes or face withholding issues.  

---

### 💰 **3. Summer Funding May Not Be Guaranteed**
U.S. humanities programs often only fund 9 months.

Summer strategies:
- RAships  
- teaching  
- external fellowships  

---

### 💰 **4. Healthcare for Families Is Often Expensive**
Single students = well covered  
Students with partners/children = often *not* fully covered  

---

### 💰 **5. Cost of Living Shock**
Some common mismatches:
- UCLA, USC → stipends too low for LA rent  
- NYU, Columbia → New York stipends require roommates  
- UC Berkeley → housing crisis + high rent  
- University of Chicago → lower stipend compared to local rent  

---

# 🔷 6. Funding Differences by Field

### **STEM**  
- Usually fully funded through RAships  
- Higher stipends  
- Funding until graduation is standard  

### **Social Sciences**  
- Fully funded but more TA-heavy  
- Funding sometimes ends after 5th or 6th year  
- External fellowships highly encouraged  

### **Humanities**  
- Guaranteed 5 years typically  
- Low stipends  
- Heavy teaching obligations  
- Must compete for year 6 funding  

---

# 🔷 7. External Fellowships — Why You Should Apply

Winning an external fellowship makes you:
- more competitive  
- more independent from your advisor  
- more appealing to faculty  
- financially more stable  

Major options:
- NSF GRFP (U.S. citizens only)  
- Ford Foundation  
- Soros Fellowship  
- Fulbright  
- SSRC  
- Mellon Fellowships  
- NDSEG (STEM)  

Winning even one of these accelerates your entire PhD.

# 🔷 8. What a Funding Letter Should Include (Checklist)

When you receive an offer, verify:

### **Basic Funding Terms**
- [ ] stipend amount  
- [ ] duration (5–6 years?)  
- [ ] summer funding  
- [ ] health insurance coverage  

### **Work Requirements**
- [ ] number of TAships required  
- [ ] number of RAships  
- [ ] expected workload  

### **Performance Requirements**
- [ ] teaching evaluations  
- [ ] progress milestones  
- [ ] GPA expectations  

### **Travel or Research Funding**
- [ ] conference funding  
- [ ] research grants  
- [ ] professional development funding  

You must compare offers **holistically**, not only by stipend.

---

# 🔷 9. How to Negotiate Funding  
(Yes — sometimes you can)

### When negotiation *is possible*:
- you have multiple offers  
- a supervisor strongly wants you  
- you have external fellowship potential  

### When negotiation is *not* possible:
- large cohorts (Humanities)  
- strict unionized funding structures  
- state universities with fixed budgets  

### What to ask for:
- additional summer funding  
- reduced teaching load  
- signing/transition funding  
- additional travel funding  

Negotiation = asking for more support to succeed, not greed.

# 🔷 10. Funding Red Flags — Programs That You Should Avoid

🚫 **Master’s programs pretending to be PhDs but unfunded**  
🚫 **PhDs requiring students to self-fund year 1 or 2**  
🚫 **Programs guaranteeing only 1–3 years of funding**  
🚫 **Programs expecting 20–30 hours/week of teaching**  
🚫 **Supervisors telling you to pay your own way and “figure it out”**  

If a program is not fully funded, it is usually designed to subsidize the department, not train researchers.

---

# 🔷 11. International Differences in PhD Funding

### **United States**
- highest stipends  
- tuition fully waived  
- RA + TA model  
- heavy departmental culture  

### **Canada**
- good stipends, but sometimes slightly lower for internationals  
- strong research funding via tri-council grants  

### **UK**
- limited full funding  
- most students self-funded unless winning a Studentship  

### **Europe**
- PhD students are *employees*  
- full salary + benefits  
- highly competitive but highly stable  

---

# 🔷 12. Final Funding Decision Checklist

# Final Thoughts

The truth about PhD funding is simple:

A PhD is **not** free — it is *paid professional training* that requires your full intellectual and emotional investment.

But if you choose the right program, your funding package will allow you to:
- focus on research  
- build professional expertise  
- develop scholarly independence  
- avoid unnecessary financial stress  

Understanding funding — deeply and strategically — is one of the most important skills applicants can develop.
