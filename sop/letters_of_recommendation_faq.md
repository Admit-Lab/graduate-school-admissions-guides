# Letters of Recommendation FAQ (PhD, Master’s, MBA, EMBA, DBA)

Strong letters of recommendation can significantly shift how a committee reads your application. This FAQ reflects common questions applicants bring to **The Admit Lab**.

---

## 1. Who Should I Ask for PhD Recommendations?

For PhD applications, prioritize:

- Professors who know your **academic and research abilities**.  
- Supervisors on theses, research projects, or independent studies.  
- In some fields, research managers in industry who can speak to research-like work.

A decent but generic letter from a famous person is less useful than a detailed letter from someone who actually knows your work.

## 2. What About Master’s, MBA, EMBA, and DBA?

### Master’s

- Mix of academic and professional references, depending on the program.
- Academic letters are valuable if you graduated recently or are applying for a more research-focused master’s.
- Professional letters matter more for applied or mid-career degrees.

### MBA

- Prefer direct supervisors who can speak to:
  - Leadership and initiative.
  - Impact and scope.
  - Growth over time.
- Avoid only academic letters unless you have very little work experience.

### EMBA

- Senior-level recommenders who can speak to:
  - Your strategic responsibilities.
  - How you operate with peers and executives.
  - Why an EMBA is timely for you now.

### DBA

- Recommenders who can speak to **both**:
  - Your professional track record.
  - Your readiness for rigorous, research-oriented work.

## 3. How Many Letters Do I Need?

Most programs ask for **2–3 letters**. Follow instructions carefully. Do not send extra letters unless explicitly allowed—more is not always better.

---

## 4. What Should I Send My Recommenders?

Make it easy for them to write a strong, specific letter.

Share:

- Your updated **CV or resume**.  
- A **short summary** of your goals and why you’re applying.  
- A list of **programs and deadlines**.  
- Bullet points reminding them of:
  - Projects you did together.
  - Contributions you made.
  - Any relevant achievements.

Some recommenders will welcome a draft or talking points; others will not. Respect their style.

---

## 5. When Should I Ask?

Ask **at least 4–6 weeks** before the deadline. Earlier is better, especially if:

- You’re asking busy senior people.  
- You need multiple letters for many schools.

If you’re applying to a large number of programs, warn them early and provide a clear, organized list.

---

## 6. What If I Had a Low Grade or a Gap?

A recommender who understands the context can sometimes help by:

- Acknowledging the issue briefly (e.g., illness, difficult semester).  
- Emphasizing your recovery and growth.  

Do not try to script this for them, but you can explain your situation honestly and let them decide what, if anything, to address.

---

## 7. Can I Use the Same Letters for Different Degree Types?

It’s better to tailor **who** you ask by degree type:

- PhD: people who know your potential as a researcher.  
- Master’s: people who know your academic ability and emerging professional direction.  
- MBA/EMBA/DBA: people who know your leadership and organizational impact.

You may use the same recommender for multiple degrees, but the **content** of the letter should ideally match the degree’s focus.

---

## 8. How Do I Follow Up Without Annoying Them?

- Send one polite reminder about a week before the deadline if the letter hasn’t been submitted.  
- Keep it simple:
  - Thank them again.
  - Re-attach the deadline and link.
- Once the letter is submitted, send a sincere thank-you and later update them on outcomes.

Good recommenders often support multiple stages of your career. Treat these relationships as long-term.
