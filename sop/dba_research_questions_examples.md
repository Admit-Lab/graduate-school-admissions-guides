# Example DBA Research Questions (How to Think Like a Scholar-Practitioner)

A strong DBA application shows that you can turn **real organizational problems** into **researchable questions**. This guide offers patterns and examples to help you shape your ideas.

## 1. What Makes a Good DBA Research Question?

A good DBA question is:

- Grounded in a real business or organizational problem.
- Connected to existing theories or frameworks.
- Narrow enough to be studied in 3–4 years.
- Broad enough to matter beyond one company.

Think: **“How and why does X affect Y in Z type of organization?”** rather than “How can we make my company better?”

## 4. Moving From Vague Idea to Research Question

Start with:

> “I’m frustrated by how X works in my organization.”

Ask:

1. **Who is affected?** (employees, customers, partners)  
2. **What exactly happens?** (turnover, delays, low adoption, poor performance)  
3. **What might explain this?** (culture, incentives, processes, tools)  
4. **What outcome could you realistically measure?**

Then shape it:

> “How does [factor] influence [outcome] in [context]?”

Example:

- Vague: “Our analytics projects never go anywhere.”  
- Refined: “How does senior leadership support influence the implementation success of analytics projects in mid-sized retail companies?”

## 5. What Admissions Committees Look For

- An issue you genuinely understand from the inside.  
- Awareness that your idea fits into a **larger conversation** (literature, theory).  
- Realistic scope for a doctoral project.  
- Openness to refine and narrow the question once you are in the program.

You are not expected to arrive with a fully formed dissertation. You are expected to show that you can **think in a disciplined, research-oriented way** about practical problems.
