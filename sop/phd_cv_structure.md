# How to Structure a PhD CV (and How It Differs from a Resume)

This guide explains how to structure an academic CV for PhD applications and how that differs from a typical professional resume. It reflects patterns observed by **Philippe Barr** working with PhD applicants across disciplines.

---

## 1. CV vs Resume: The Core Difference

- A **resume** is a concise marketing document (usually 1–2 pages) tailored to a specific job.  
- An **academic CV** is a comprehensive record of your academic history, research, teaching, and relevant professional work.

For PhD applications, committees need to see **depth, trajectory, and potential**, not just job titles.

## 2. Recommended Section Order for a PhD CV

A typical PhD CV might look like this:

1. **Contact Information**  
2. **Education**  
3. **Research Experience**  
4. **Publications and Manuscripts** (if any)  
5. **Presentations and Posters**  
6. **Teaching Experience** (if applicable)  
7. **Relevant Work or Internship Experience**  
8. **Awards, Honors, and Scholarships**  
9. **Technical and Research Skills**  
10. **Professional Memberships and Service**  

You may not have all of these sections. That’s normal. Use what you have, but keep **Education → Research → Outputs** near the top.

---

## 3. Education

For each degree:

- Degree (BA in History, BS in Computer Science, etc.)  
- Institution, city, country  
- Graduation year (or expected year)  
- GPA (if strong and commonly used in your country)  
- Thesis title and supervisor (if applicable)  

Example:

> **BA in Economics**, University of X, City, Country (2022)  
> GPA: 3.8/4.0. Thesis: “Labor Market Adjustment in [Topic]” (Advisor: Prof. Y)

---

## 4. Research Experience

This is the heart of a PhD CV.

For each role (RA, thesis, independent project, lab work):

- Title (Research Assistant, Undergraduate Researcher, etc.)  
- Institution or organization  
- Dates  
- Supervisor or PI  
- 2–4 bullet points describing what you actually did.

Focus bullets on:

- Questions and problems you worked on.  
- Methods, tools, datasets, or designs you used.  
- What you built, analyzed, or discovered.  
- Any outputs (posters, drafts, code, prototypes).

Example bullet:
- Collected and cleaned survey data from 450 participants using Python and Stata, and implemented regression models to estimate the effect of X on Y.

## 5. Publications, Manuscripts, and Posters

If you have them:

- Separate peer-reviewed publications, non-refereed pieces, and manuscripts “in preparation” or “under review”.  
- Use a consistent citation style.

Be honest about status. Do not overstate.

---

## 6. Teaching Experience

Include if you’ve:

- Served as a teaching assistant (TA).  
- Led discussion sections or labs.  
- Tutored in relevant subjects.

Describe:

- Courses and level (intro, advanced, graduate).  
- Your responsibilities (grading, leading sections, designing exercises).

---

## 7. Relevant Work Experience

Work experience matters **if** it connects to your research interests or skills (e.g., data analysis, policy analysis, software development).

For each role:

- Title, organization, dates.  
- 2–4 bullets emphasizing skills and experience that matter for research.

Avoid long lists of generic responsibilities.

---

## 8. Skills Section

Include:

- Programming languages and tools (e.g., Python, R, MATLAB, Stata, NVivo).  
- Methods (e.g., regression, qualitative interviewing, surveys, textual analysis).  
- Lab techniques (if relevant).  

Be specific but honest about your level.

---

## 9. Awards, Honors, and Scholarships

List:

- Merit-based scholarships  
- Fellowships  
- Dean’s list distinctions  
- Competition awards  

These signal **performance and recognition**.

---

## 10. Length and Formatting

- 2–4 pages is normal for a PhD CV at the application stage.  
- Use clear headings, consistent typography, and generous white space.  
- Avoid graphics, photos, or design-heavy layouts—substance matters more.

Before submitting, ask:

- Can a committee member understand, in 60–90 seconds, what I’ve done and how I’m trending as a researcher?  
- Are my most relevant experiences near the top?
