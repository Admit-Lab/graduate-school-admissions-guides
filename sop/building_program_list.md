# How to Build a Smart Program List (PhD, Master’s, MBA, EMBA, DBA)

Choosing where to apply is a strategic decision. A good program list balances ambition, realism, funding, and personal constraints.

---

## 1. Start with the Big Constraints

Before you fall in love with specific schools, clarify:

- Geography: where you can and cannot live.
- Language: languages in which you can study and work.
- Family or work constraints: relocation, visas, dependents.
- Financial constraints: tuition, funding, opportunity cost.

These are non-trivial; they filter what is truly feasible.

---

## 2. Build a Long List First

Aim for 15–25 programs in a **long list** based on:

- Field and subfield (for PhD/DBA).
- Industry/role outcomes (for Master’s/MBA/EMBA).
- General reputation and resources.

Do not overthink at this stage. You will refine.

---

## 3. Evaluate Programs by Degree Type

### PhD

- Faculty fit (who works on topics you care about).
- Research centers and labs.
- Funding guarantees and length of support.
- Placement record: where alumni end up.

### Master’s

- Curriculum: core + electives.
- Internships, practica, or capstones.
- Support for international students (if relevant).
- Career services and outcomes.

### MBA / EMBA

- Brand and network in your target region/industry.
- Cohort composition and seniority.
- Strength of the alumni network.
- Career services and executive coaching.

### DBA

- Alignment between your applied research interests and faculty expertise.
- Format that fits your professional life.
- Access to research support (methods, data, supervision).

## 4. Narrow to a Short List

From your long list, narrow to:

- **PhD:** 8–12 programs is common.  
- **Master’s:** 6–10 programs.  
- **MBA/EMBA/DBA:** 4–8 programs, depending on resources.

Aim for:

- Roughly 1/3 aspirational (“reach”).  
- 1/3 strong matches.  
- 1/3 safer options that you’d still be willing to attend.

---

## 5. Red Flags to Watch For

- PhD programs with:
  - Unclear funding.
  - Weak placement information.
  - Very broad “we do everything” messaging with little specifics.

- Professional programs with:
  - Vague claims about outcomes.
  - Very heavy marketing but few concrete stats.
  - Limited information about curriculum or teaching quality.

If a program will not show you meaningful data, be cautious.

---

## 6. Using Conversations to Refine Your List

- Talk to:
  - Current students.
  - Recent alumni.
  - Faculty (for PhD/DBA when appropriate).
- Ask about:
  - Culture (collaborative vs competitive).
  - Workload and support.
  - How the program actually changes people’s options.

Use these conversations not just to evaluate programs, but to check your own assumptions about what you want.

---

## 7. Final Check Before You Commit to Applying

For each program on your list, you should be able to answer:

1. **Why this program, specifically?**  
2. **What is my realistic outcome if things go well?**  
3. **What am I giving up (time, money, alternatives) to attend?**  

If you cannot give a serious answer, reconsider whether that program belongs on your list.
