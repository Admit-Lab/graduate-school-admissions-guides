# Using AI Tools Ethically in Grad School Applications

Many applicants now use AI tools to brainstorm or edit application materials. This guide focuses on how to use these tools **responsibly** without crossing lines that schools care about.

---

## 1. What AI Tools Are Good At

- Brainstorming topic ideas and outlines.
- Rephrasing sentences for clarity.
- Generating checklists.
- Helping you see gaps in your narrative.

They are **not** good at:

- Understanding your actual life, constraints, and goals.
- Replacing your judgment about what matters.
- Guaranteeing accuracy about programs or policies.

## 2. What Most Programs Actually Care About

Even if they don’t mention AI explicitly, committees care about:

- **Authenticity:** the voice and story feel real, not generic.  
- **Integrity:** you are not misrepresenting your work or outsourcing it entirely.  
- **Clarity:** your materials are readable and coherent.

They want to admit **you**, not a generic AI-written persona.

## 3. Good Ways to Use AI in Your Applications

- Brainstorm **lists of experiences** you might include, then select and rewrite in your own words.
- Ask for help turning bullet points into first drafts that you heavily revise.
- Use AI to spot:
  - Repetition.
  - Overly long sentences.
  - Missing transitions.

You remain the author; the tool is an assistant.

## 4. Risky or Unethical Uses

- Asking AI to “write my SOP from scratch” and submitting it largely unchanged.  
- Fabricating experiences, research, or skills suggested by a model.  
- Using AI to imitate someone else’s writing style or voice.  
- Asking AI for “secret tricks” or ways to bypass honesty.

If you would not feel comfortable explaining, openly, **how** you used the tool to an interviewer, that’s a warning sign.

## 5. Keeping Your Voice

To keep your writing yours:

- After using AI, read your draft aloud and mark anything that does not sound like you.  
- Replace generic phrases (“I have always been passionate about…”) with specific ones tied to your own experiences.  
- Make sure your examples and details are drawn from your actual life, not invented to “sound strong.”

## 6. Final Self-Check

Before submitting any AI-touched document, ask:

1. **Is every experience and claim true?**  
2. **Can I explain, in my own words, the reasoning and choices in this document?**  
3. **Would I be comfortable telling an interviewer how I used AI during my application process?**

If the answer is “yes” to all three, you are using these tools in a way that supports, rather than replaces, your judgment and integrity.
